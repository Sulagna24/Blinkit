# Blinkit

1. **Project Background**
    
    I worked on a sales analysis project focused on Blinkit’s performance in Tier 3 city outlets. The goal was to understand what products were selling the most, how different outlet types were performing, and what customer preferences looked like in smaller cities.
    
2. **Executive Summary**
    
    Tier 3 outlets recorded total sales of ₹472.13K across 3,000 items. The average item rating stands at 3.92, with average sales per item around ₹140.94. Regular fat content dominates, and medium-sized outlets drive the highest volume.
    
3. **Insights Deep-Dive**
    
    Fruits, Snacks, and Household items are the top-selling categories. Regular fat products outperform low-fat ones. Medium outlets are leading in sales, while Supermarket Types 1–3 clearly perform better than Grocery Stores.
    
4. **Sales Trends and Growth Rates**
    
    There’s clear upward momentum in sales from 2010 to 2015, with consistent performance maintained through 2020 and beyond. This reflects market stabilization and possible saturation in Tier 3 cities.
    
5. **Key Product Performance**
    
    High-performing categories include Fruits, Snacks, and Household essentials. Lower-performing items such as Breads, Hard Drinks, and Breakfast items may need promotions, repackaging, or repositioning.
    
6. **Recommendations**
    
    Double down on marketing bestsellers (Fruits, Snacks, Household items). Improve visibility or placement for low-sellers. Focus expansion on medium-sized outlets.
    
    Overall, this project helped me learn how to **analyze performance by outlet type, product category, and timeline**, and how to generate useful business recommendations using clean dashboards and storytelling.
